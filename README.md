The project "Human Resource Management Employee Promotion Prediction Using Machine Learning" aims to enhance HR decision-making by developing a predictive model for employee promotions. By analyzing historical data on performance, skills, experience, and other factors, the model identifies patterns indicating promotion potential.

Utilizing various machine learning algorithms, key inputs such as employee demographics, education, tenure, and performance reviews are processed. This data-driven approach reduces human bias, fosters equity, and streamlines the promotion process.

Benefits include proactive talent management, identifying high-potential employees, and aligning their career paths with organizational goals. It also saves time and resources, enhancing employee satisfaction and retention. By integrating this model into HR workflows, companies can modernize practices, making them more efficient, transparent, and aligned with contemporary business needs. This project represents a significant advancement in strategic talent management and organizational growth.
